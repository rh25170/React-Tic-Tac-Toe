# React Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the React Tic-Tac-Toe application! This project is my implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial provided by React, which you can find [here](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

In this game, two players take turns to mark cells in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This implementation utilizes React to manage the UI and game state. It's a great example for beginners to understand the fundamentals of React and how to build a simple interactive application.

## Setup

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd react-tic-tac-toe
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser. You can now play Tic-Tac-Toe!

## How to Play

- The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move.
- Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their mark (X or O).
- The game indicates whose turn it is at the top of the board.
- The game ends when one player has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled.
- If a player wins, the winning cells are highlighted, and the game displays a message indicating the winner.
- If the game ends in a draw, a draw message is displayed.

## Features

- Interactive UI built with React components.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Highlights winning cells for easy identification.
- Tracks and displays game history, allowing players to revisit previous moves.
